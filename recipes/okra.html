    <p>Ila is the Yoruba word for Okra, and Asepo means “To cook together”;
          ila Alasepo is mixed okra soup. In regular Yoruba style, okro is 
          typically served with stew.</p>
    <p>On the nutrition scale: okra is rich in Fibre, protein, Vitamins k/c, 
        Folate and Magnesium.  I turned this soup into a “rich” soup by making 
        use of a wide variety of proteins.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800g chopped Okra</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>200g beef washed</li>
        <li>Locust beans (Iru tete)</li>
        <li>Smoked fish</li>
        <li>Smoked ponmo, washed and diced</li>
        <li>800g Assorted beef & dried cod, washed and cut to small pieces (I used ponmo, shaki and panla)</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper (use according to your preference)</li>
        <li>Water/ stock (1.5 to 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Ground crayfish</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Ukazi leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>Ginger and garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Preps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the Okra into smooth slimy feel</li>
        <li>Wash locust beans and set aside</li>
        <li>Chop 1 onion and set aside</li>
        <li>Shred the smoked fish into flakes and also set aside</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Preparing Ila Alasepo</h2>
    <p>Place a pan on medium heat and add beef, assorted beef and dried cod,
         salt, seasoning, onion, ginger, garlic and little water (adjust salt and 
         seasoning to your taste) bring all to boil until tender. You can use a 
         pressure cooker for this as it is quicker.</p>

    <p>beef and fish are tender as desired, separate the stock from it and sieve 
            to achieve a clean stock. (Skip this step if you are ok with the bit and bob from stock)</p> 
        
    <p>Place a clean pan on medium heat then add the stock about (1.5 cups) the beef, assorted beef 
            and dried fish and bring to boil for about 3-5 minutes, add potash then the chopped okro. Stir 
            till all is well combined and cook for another minute</p>
    <p>Add crayfish and cayenne pepper. Stir till well combined, add palm oil, stir and cook for about
             2 minutes</p>

    <p>Add seasoning and salt (adjust salt and seasoning to own taste especially if you are using stock) 
        add ukazi leaves (if using) stir and add smoked mackerel then cook for another 2-3 minutes.</p>
